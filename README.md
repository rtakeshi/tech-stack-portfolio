### Data Engineering Tech Stack Project

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical use of common tools in the data engineering tech stack.

##### What I'm doing in this project?

Using Terraform, I create a storage that simulates a Data Lake in Azure Cloud.

I build a pipeline implementing ELT concepts, creating a bronze layer in the storage.

I create a second pipeline implementing ETL concepts, where I tidy up the data, forming the silver layer.

Leveraging a free instance of Snowflake, I create an analytics-ready data warehouse, forming the gold layer.
